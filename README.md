# Memento QC and formatting

This repository gathers scripts and functions used
for all operations prior to fMRI preprocessing in Memento.
Includes generating reports on existing files,
switching to BIDS, removing improperly formatted files
and performing automated QC.

Scripts were run using vscode's extension for
jupyter-like cells, hence the `# %%` tags
