# Memento QC and formatting

This repository gathers scripts and functions used
for all operations prior to fMRI preprocessing in Memento.
Includes generating reports on existing files,
switching to BIDS, removing improperly formatted files
and performing automated QC.

Most of the scripts were run using vscode's extension for
jupyter-like cells, hence the `# %%` tags.

Scripts starting with 01, 02, 04 and 05 are able to write to BIDS directory,
make sure you understand what they do before executing.
